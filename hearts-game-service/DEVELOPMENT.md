## Card Play Flow (Backend) - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### HTTP Endpoint (`/play-card`) ‚úÖ WORKING

- The `/play-card` endpoint delegates card play logic to the same handler as the socket event (`handlePlayCard` in `socketHandler`).
- When a card is played via HTTP, the backend simulates a socket event for the user, ensuring all validation, state updates, and broadcasts are handled identically to socket.io clients.
- After a valid play, the backend emits a personalized `game-state` event to each connected player (each player only sees their own hand)
- The HTTP response contains `{ success: true }` or an error; all real-time updates are delivered via socket.io.
- This ensures consistent game logic and state delivery for both HTTP and socket clients.

### Socket.IO Event (`play-card`) ‚úÖ WORKING

- Real-time card playing through WebSocket events with immediate game state updates
- Server-side validation of all card plays according to Hearts rules
- Automatic bot play integration when it's a bot's turn
- Trick completion detection with proper scoring and winner determination

### Notes
- Both HTTP and Socket.IO interfaces use the same backend validation and game logic
- All real-time updates are broadcast via Socket.IO to maintain game synchronization
- Server remains authoritative for all game state and rule enforcement

# Hearts Game Service - Development Guide

## üéØ Service Overview

**Purpose**: Complete real-time multiplayer Hearts card game with lobby system and comprehensive game management  
**Port**: 3004  
**Role**: WebSocket-based card game with full Hearts rules implementation, AI bot support, and database persistence  
**Dependencies**: auth-service, PostgreSQL database, Socket.IO  
**Security**: JWT authentication required (approved users only)  
**Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Socket.IO client for real-time lobby and game management

## üéÆ Current Implementation Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ‚úÖ

This Hearts game service is **completely implemented and operational** with all core features working:

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- **Complete Hearts Game**: Full implementation of standard 4-player Hearts rules
- **Lobby System**: 4-seat lobby with player management, ready states, and leader controls
- **AI Bot Integration**: Server-side bots that can be added to empty seats with automated gameplay
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Socket.IO-based live synchronization of all game actions
- **Card Passing**: Complete atomic passing system (left/right/across/none) with synchronization
- **Trick Playing**: Full trick-taking gameplay with Hearts rule validation
- **Scoring System**: Traditional Hearts scoring including "shooting the moon" detection
- **Database Persistence**: Complete game tracking with PostgreSQL storage
- **Reconnection Support**: Players can disconnect and rejoin with full state restoration
- **Dual API**: Both Socket.IO events and HTTP endpoints for maximum compatibility

## üÉè Game Rules Implementation

### Standard Hearts Rules
- **Players**: Exactly 4 players required
- **Objective**: Lowest score wins (hearts = -1 point, Queen of Spades = -13 points)
- **Shooting the Moon**: Taking all hearts + Queen of Spades = +26 points to all other players
- **Game End**: First player to reach 100 points (or more) triggers game end
- **Winner**: Player with lowest score when game ends

### Card Passing System

### Card Passing System ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The atomic card passing system is completely implemented and working:

#### Backend Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Atomic Passing**: When a player selects 3 cards and presses Pass Cards, their selection is saved but cards are not exchanged until all 4 players have passed
- **Synchronization**: Backend tracks each player's passed cards and only exchanges them when all players are ready
- **State Management**: Game remains in 'passing' state until all players complete their passing, then transitions to 'playing'
- **Validation**: Server validates that exactly 3 cards are passed and they exist in the player's hand

#### Frontend Implementation ‚úÖ  
- **Pass Cards Button**: Only enabled when exactly 3 cards are selected
- **Waiting State**: After passing, button is disabled and waiting message is shown until all players have passed
- **Hand Updates**: Player hands are only updated after all players have passed and the playing phase begins
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of passing progress and waiting for other players

#### Bot Integration ‚úÖ
- **Automated Passing**: Bots automatically select and pass 3 random cards when it's their turn
- **Seamless Integration**: Bot passing is handled server-side and integrates with the same atomic passing system
- **No Delays**: Bots pass immediately when the passing phase begins, but still respect the atomic synchronization

### Trick Playing ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Leading**: Player with 2 of Clubs leads first trick (implemented in HeartsGame model)
- **Following Suit**: Players must follow suit if possible (server-side validation)
- **Hearts Breaking**: Hearts cannot be led until hearts have been "broken" by playing hearts on a trick (implemented)
- **First Trick Rules**: Hearts and Queen of Spades cannot be played on first trick (enforced)
- **Bot Strategy**: AI bots follow suit when possible, otherwise play Queen of Spades, then highest heart, then highest card

### Game Completion ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
- **End Condition**: Game ends when a player reaches 100+ points (implemented)
- **Winner Determination**: Player with lowest score wins (implemented in database results)
- **Database Persistence**: Final results saved to `hearts_game_results` table with rankings
- **Shooting the Moon**: Taking all hearts + Queen of Spades gives 26 points to all other players (implemented)

- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Proper data integrity enforcement
- **Statistics View**: `hearts_player_stats` view for analytics
- **Game Persistence**: Complete game state saving and restoration
- **Historical Tracking**: Full game history with trick-by-trick details

## üéÆ Core Game Logic - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Complete Game Implementation

The entire Hearts game logic is implemented and working in the `models/HeartsGame.js` class:

#### Game State Management ‚úÖ
- **Lobby System**: 4-seat lobby with player management, ready states, and bot support
- **Game Progression**: Automatic progression through lobby ‚Üí passing ‚Üí playing ‚Üí finished states  
- **Round Management**: Traditional Hearts rounds with proper card passing rotation
- **Trick Management**: Complete trick-taking logic with winner determination

#### Card Management ‚úÖ  
- **Deck Generation**: Standard 52-card deck with proper shuffling
- **Card Dealing**: 13 cards per player with sorted hands
- **Hand Management**: Proper card removal and validation
- **Card Validation**: Server-side validation of all card plays according to Hearts rules

#### Rule Enforcement ‚úÖ
- **Suit Following**: Must follow suit if possible (enforced)
- **Hearts Breaking**: Hearts cannot be led until broken (enforced)
- **First Trick Rules**: No hearts or Queen of Spades on first trick (enforced)
- **Valid Leads**: Proper lead card validation including 2 of Clubs first trick

#### Scoring System ‚úÖ
- **Point Calculation**: Hearts = 1 point, Queen of Spades = 13 points  
- **Shooting the Moon**: Taking all hearts + QS gives 26 points to others (implemented)
- **Game End**: First to 100+ points triggers end, lowest score wins (implemented)
- **Round Tracking**: Individual round scores and cumulative totals

#### AI Bot Integration ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Bot strategies implemented in gameManager.js
- **Passing Strategy**: Bots select 3 random cards to pass
- **Playing Strategy**: 
  1. Follow suit with lowest card when possible
  2. If can't follow suit: play Queen of Spades, then highest heart, then highest card
- **Server-side Execution**: All bot decisions made server-side for integrity
- **Automatic Timing**: Bots play with configurable delays for natural pacing
```
- When all players have passed, the backend updates all hands, clears the passing state, sets the game to the playing round, and emits the new game state.

#### Frontend
- The Pass Cards button is enabled only when 3 cards are selected.
- After passing, the button is disabled and a waiting message is shown.
- The hand is only updated after all players have passed and the backend starts the playing phase.

### Game State Machine
```javascript
class HeartsGameState {
    constructor() {
        this.state = 'lobby'; // lobby -> passing -> playing -> finished
        this.players = new Map(); // seat -> player data
        this.spectators = new Set();
        this.currentTrick = [];
        this.tricksWon = new Map(); // seat -> tricks won this round
        this.roundScores = new Map(); // seat -> score this round
        this.totalScores = new Map(); // seat -> total game score
    }
    
    // State transitions
    startGame() { /* Validate 4 ready players, deal cards */ }
    startPassing() { /* Begin card passing phase */ }
    startPlaying() { /* All cards passed, begin trick play */ }
    playCard(seat, card) { /* Validate and play card */ }
    completeTrick() { /* Determine winner, start next trick */ }
    endRound() { /* Calculate scores, check game end */ }
    endGame() { /* Save final results to database */ }
}
```

### Card Dealing Algorithm
```javascript
class CardDealer {
    static dealCards() {
        const deck = this.generateDeck();
        this.shuffleDeck(deck);
        
        const hands = [[], [], [], []];
        for (let i = 0; i < 52; i++) {
            hands[i % 4].push(deck[i]);
        }
        
        return hands.map(hand => this.sortHand(hand));
    }
    
    static generateDeck() {
        const suits = ['C', 'D', 'H', 'S']; // Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades
        const ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'];
        return suits.flatMap(suit => ranks.map(rank => rank + suit));
    }
}
```

### AI Bot Implementation (Future Enhancement)
```javascript
class HeartsBot {
        // Production-ready simple bot implementation notes
        // Current service implements a simple, server-side bot (AI) that can be added
        // to any empty seat by the lobby leader. Bots are marked as ready automatically
        // and participate in both the passing and playing phases.

        // Strategy implemented in this service (simple, predictable):
        // - Passing: Bot selects 3 random cards to pass when required.
        // - Playing: When following suit, bot plays the lowest possible card in that suit.
        //   If the bot cannot follow suit, it plays in this priority order:
        //     1) Queen of Spades (QS)
        //     2) Highest Heart
        //     3) Highest card available
        // This behavior is implemented in `services/gameManager.js` as `botPassCards(seat)`
        // and `botPlayCard(seat)` and is invoked by `services/socketHandler.js`.

        // Bot behaviour is intentionally simple to keep games predictable and avoid
        // complex card counting. The bot runs entirely on the server for authoritative
        // state and to avoid any client-side trust issues.
}

### Recent Implementation Notes (2025-08-15)
- Server-side AI bots: lobby leader may add a bot to any empty seat. Bots are
    auto-ready and will pass and play automatically.
- Passing: bots call `gameManager.botPassCards(seat)` which returns a pass result
    and the backend broadcasts updated `game-state` after each bot action.
- Playing: bots call `gameManager.botPlayCard(seat)`. When a play completes a trick
    the server now follows this precise sequence for consistency across clients:
    1. Emit `trick-completed` (immediate) with trick payload (cards, winner, points).
    2. Await a short display interval (default 1500ms) so clients can render the
         completed trick visually.
    3. Broadcast the updated `game-state` (this clears `currentTrickCards` on clients).
    4. Wait an inter-bot pacing delay (default 700ms) before continuing with next bot.

- This ordering is centralized in `services/socketHandler.js` to avoid client/server
    race conditions. A helper `broadcastGameStateToRoom(gameId, delayMs)` was added
    to centralize personalized `game-state` broadcasts.

- Client-side safety: the browser client listens for `trick-completed` and
    transiently renders the trick for the same display interval as a visual safety
    net. The server remains authoritative; the client transient will not override
    later authoritative `game-state` updates.

Notes & rationale:
- Centralizing the trick display timing on the server ensures all clients see the
    trick for the same duration regardless of network delays or message ordering.
- The two delays (display interval and inter-bot pacing) are tunable constants
    in `socketHandler.js` and can be adjusted for UX preference.
