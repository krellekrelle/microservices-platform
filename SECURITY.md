# Security Documentation

## Database Security

### Current Configuration
- Database credentials are now stored in environment variables (`.env` file)
- Database password has been updated to a secure value
- All services use environment variable references instead of hardcoded credentials

### Environment Variables
The following database credentials are configured in `.env`:
```
POSTGRES_DB=microservices_platform
POSTGRES_USER=app_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Kl_P1_M1cr0serv1ces_2025_SecureDB!#
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: All database credentials moved from hardcoded values to environment variables
2. **Strong Password**: Database password updated with complexity requirements
3. **Documentation**: Removed hardcoded credentials from all documentation files
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration separated from code

### Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Critical**: The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and should NEVER be committed to version control.

✅ **Protected**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### For Production Deployment

When deploying to production, consider these additional security measures:

1. **Secrets Management**: Use a proper secrets management system (Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault)
2. **Database Access**: Restrict database access to only required services
3. **Network Security**: Use private networks for database communication
4. **Regular Updates**: Rotate passwords regularly
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for database access

### Emergency Procedures

If credentials are compromised:
1. Immediately change the password in `.env`
2. Restart all database-dependent services: `docker compose restart database auth-service lol-tracking-service`
3. Review access logs for suspicious activity
